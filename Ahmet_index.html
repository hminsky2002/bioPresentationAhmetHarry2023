# Behavioural susceptibility theory 

The role of **appetite** in genetic susceptibility to obesity in early life 

[Article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10363697/) from NIH reviews the research findings to understand how genetic susceptibility and appetite play roles in childhood obesity. 

--
name: bst

Key Takeaways: 

- Genetic susceptibility plays a significant role, influencing variations in early appetite, which is present from birth.

--
name: bst

- Early appetite is heritable, correlates with overconsumption, predicts future weight gain, and shares common genetic influences with overall weight.

--
name: bst

- Children with a strong appetite are more prone to overeating and obesity when surrounded by pervasive food cues, while those with a smaller appetite are less likely to become obese, regardless of their food environment.

# Defining the neural basis of appetite and obesity: from genes to behaviour

[Article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4952542/) from NIH discusses how genetic studies have contributed to our understanding of the mechanisms involved in the regulation of body weight.

--
name: def

Key Takeaways: 

- Family, twin and adoption studies suggest that the heritability of body weight ranges between 40% and 70%.

- The hormone leptin, produced by fat cells, plays a vital role in signaling the body's need for food. Genetic mutations in leptin pathways can lead to an intense drive to eat and impaired satiety. 

--
name: def

- Understanding genetic factors contributing to obesity can guide the development of targeted therapies. For example, treatment with recombinant human leptin injections for individuals with genetic disposition leptin deficiency.

# The Body-Mass Index of Twins Who Have Been Reared Apart

[Article](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejm199005243222102) from The New England Journal of Medicine analyzes body mass index of twins who has been reaared apart.

--
name: twin 

Key Takeaways: 

- Strong influence of heredity on body mass index. 0.70 for men and 0.66 for women.

--
name: twin

- Nonadditive genetics effects are significant. Not just having certain genes but how those genes work together.

--
name: twin 

- Neither the shared rearing environment nor correlated environments contributed to variation in the body-mass index.
